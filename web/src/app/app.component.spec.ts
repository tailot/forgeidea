 * other basic functionalities, though this specific file only includes a
 * creation test. `RouterTestingModule` is imported to handle any router

   * - Importing the `AppComponent` itself to make it available for testing.
   * - Importing `RouterTestingModule` to provide a mock implementation for
   *   Angular's routing services, which `AppComponent` might depend on (e.g.,
   *   if it uses `<router-outlet>` or `routerLink`).
   * `compileComponents()` is called to compile the component's template and CSS
   * if not using Webpack (though with modern Angular CLI and Webpack, it's often not strictly necessary
   * for JIT mode tests but is good practice for AOT compatibility and when dealing with templateUrl/styleUrls).
