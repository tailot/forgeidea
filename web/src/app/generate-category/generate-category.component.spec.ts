/**
 * @fileoverview This file contains unit tests for the `GenerateCategoryComponent`.

 * is imported to mock HTTP requests, which is essential for testing components
 * that interact with backend services via HTTP without making actual network calls.
 * The tests aim to ensure the component's correct creation and behavior, particularly
 * its data fetching or submission logic if applicable (though this specific file
 * currently only includes a basic creation test).
