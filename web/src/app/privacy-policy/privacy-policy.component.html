    <h1>Privacy Policy for forgeIdea</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 13, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to forgeIdea (hereinafter referred to as the "Service"). Your privacy is very important to me. This Privacy Policy describes how I collect, use, and protect the personal information of users of my Service.</p>

    <p>By using the Service, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The Data Controller is:</p>
    <p>
        Vincenzo Tilotta<br>
        Contact Email: <a href="mailto:tailot@gmail.com">tailot&#64;gmail.com</a><br>
        Website: <a [href]="websiteUrl" target="_blank">{{ websiteUrl }}</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Types of Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The Service is designed to function without the use of traditional tracking or profiling cookies. However, to ensure functionality and improve your user experience, I use your browser's internal database, IndexedDB.</p>
    <p>Data that may be stored in your browser's database includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User preferences:</strong> Settings customized by you to improve your experience using the Service, such as textual idea extraction options.</li>
        <li><strong>Application data:</strong> Specific information generated or used by the application during its operation, which is saved in your browser to allow offline use or to preserve the application's state between sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do not actively collect personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>3. Purposes of Data Processing</h2>
    <p>The data stored in your browser's database is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and maintain the Service:</strong> To allow the proper functioning of the features offered.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve user experience:</strong> To remember your preferences and personalize the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>To enable offline functionality:</strong> To allow the use of some parts of the Service even without an internet connection.</li>
        <li><strong>To save application state:</strong> To restore the application state or data you entered between different usage sessions or when migrating to another browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Processing and Storage Methods</h2>
    <p>Data is stored directly in your browser's database on your device. The data resides locally on your computer or mobile device and is not generally transmitted to servers, except for specific functionalities explicitly indicated in section 7.</p>
    <p>This data remains stored in your browser until you manually delete it (website data) or until any expiration period set by the application itself for specific data is reached. I do not have direct access to this data stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>The processing of data stored in your browser is based on my legitimate interest in providing a functional and personalized service. Regarding preferences and application data, processing is based on your implicit consent, given through your use of the Service and configuration of your preferences.</p>

    <h2>6. Absence of Cookies</h2>
    <p>The Service does not use HTTP cookies for user tracking or profiling. The use of the browser database is solely aimed at improving the functionality and usability of the Service as described above.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Communication and Dissemination</h2>
    <p>Data stored in your browser's database is not communicated to third parties or disseminated, as it resides on your device. The Service allows you to share ideas generated through artificial intelligence mechanisms with other users connected to the same Service.</p>

    <h2>8. Rights of the Data Subject</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access data:</strong> You can view the data stored by the Service through its interface or your browser's developer tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete data (right to be forgotten):</strong> You can delete or modify the data stored in your browser's database at any time. This can be done via a dedicated button in the settings section (represented by a gear icon) or typically through your browser's privacy and history settings (e.g., "Clear Browse Data," "Manage Website Data"). Deleting this data may result in the loss of customizations or the application's state.</li>
        <li><strong>Restrict or object to processing:</strong> You can configure your browser to block data storage by websites, although this may compromise the functionality of the Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For privacy-related questions or to exercise your rights concerning other personal data I may process (for example, if you have contacted me via email), you can contact me at the email address provided in the "Data Controller" section.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>I adopt technical and organizational measures to protect data that may be transmitted to my servers (e.g., when sharing textual ideas). However, for data stored locally in your browser's database, security also depends on the security measures you take on your device and browser.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by providing notice to users on this page. Therefore, please consult this page regularly, referring to the "Last updated" date at the top. If you do not accept the changes made to this Privacy Policy, you must cease using this Service and may request that I remove your Personal Data (if applicable and stored by me).</p>
