 * @fileoverview This file contains unit tests for the `BottonIdeaComponent`.

 * is imported to mock HTTP requests, allowing for isolated testing of the
 * component's behavior when it interacts with backend services via HTTP.
 * The tests aim to ensure the component's creation and potentially its interactions
 * with HTTP services, although this specific file currently only includes a
